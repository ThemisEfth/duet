Description: Analyzes non-verbal communication by processing data extracted 
    from video recordings of dyadic interactions. It supports integration 
    with open source tools, currently limited to 'OpenPose' (Cao et al. (2019) 
    <doi:10.1109/TPAMI.2019.2929257>), converting its outputs into CSV format 
    for further analysis. The package includes functions for data pre-processing, 
    visualization, and computation of motion indices such as velocity, acceleration, 
    and jerkiness (Cook et al. (2013) <doi:10.1093/brain/awt208>), facilitating 
    the analysis of non-verbal cues in paired interactions and contributing to 
    research on human communication dynamics.
