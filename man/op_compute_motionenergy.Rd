\usage{
op_compute_motionenergy(
  data,
  id_cols = NULL,
  frame_col = "frame",
  aggregate_keypoints = TRUE,
  aggregate_coordinates = TRUE,
  method = c("absolute", "squared"),
  na_action = c("omit", "interpolate", "zero"),
  plot = FALSE,
  rmea_format = FALSE
)
}
\arguments{
\item{data}{A data.frame containing OpenPose data with columns for keypoint
coordinates (x0, y0, x1, y1, etc.) and grouping variables.}

\item{id_cols}{Character vector of column names used for grouping. If NULL
(default), automatically detects ID columns as all non-coordinate,
non-frame columns (excludes columns starting with x, y, c and frame column).}

\item{frame_col}{Character string specifying the frame column name.
Default: "frame"}

\item{aggregate_keypoints}{Logical. If TRUE, aggregates motion across all
keypoints. If FALSE, returns motion energy per keypoint. Default: TRUE}

\item{aggregate_coordinates}{Logical. If TRUE, combines x and y motion into
single metric using Euclidean distance. If FALSE, keeps separate.
Default: TRUE}

\item{method}{Character. Method for calculating differences:
\itemize{
  \item{"absolute"}: Calculates the sum of absolute differences in coordinates between frames.
    This method provides a linear measure of change and is sensitive to smaller movements.
    The resulting values are directly interpretable as the magnitude of change.
  \item{"squared"}: Calculates the sum of squared differences in coordinates between frames.
    This method amplifies larger movements more significantly than smaller ones, making it
    potentially more sensitive to bursts of activity or more pronounced changes.
    It's often used when the impact of larger movements needs to be emphasized.
}
Default: "absolute"}

\item{na_action}{Character. How to handle missing values: "omit" removes
frames with missing data, "interpolate" uses linear interpolation,
"zero" treats missing as zero motion. Default: "omit"}

\item{plot}{Logical. If TRUE, generates a plot of motion energy over frames
when data is fully aggregated (aggregate_keypoints = TRUE and
aggregate_coordinates = TRUE). The plot will be grouped by the 'person'
column if it's one of the id_cols, otherwise by the first id_col.
Default: FALSE}

\item{rmea_format}{Logical. If TRUE, converts output to wide format with
columns for region*person combinations, removing all other columns.
Default: FALSE}
}
\value{
A data.frame with motion energy values. Structure depends on
  aggregation parameters:
  \itemize{
    \item If both aggregation options TRUE: ID columns + frame + motion_energy
    \item If aggregate_coordinates FALSE: adds x_motion, y_motion columns
    \item If aggregate_keypoints FALSE: adds keypoint column
    \item If rmea_format TRUE: wide format with region*person columns only
  }
  If `plot = TRUE` and conditions are met, a ggplot object is also printed.

\description{
Performs frame differencing analysis on OpenPose keypoint data to calculate
motion energy.
This function computes the amount of movement between consecutive frames
for each keypoint, with options for aggregation and filtering.
}
\details{
The function processes OpenPose data by:
1. Auto-detecting ID columns (if not specified) as columns that don't start with x, y, c
2. Grouping data by the ID columns
3. Computing frame-to-frame differences based on the chosen method
4. Aggregating results based on user preferences

Motion energy is calculated as the absolute or squared difference between
consecutive frames. When aggregating coordinates, Euclidean distance is used:
sqrt(x_diff^2 + y_diff^2) if method is "absolute" (applied after diff), or
x_diff^2 + y_diff^2 if method is "squared" (as diffs are already squared).
Note: The Euclidean combination for "squared" method is implicitly handled as
`sqrt((x_diff^2)^2 + (y_diff^2)^2)` if `aggregate_coordinates` is TRUE *after* squaring,
or more commonly, the squared differences are summed directly if that's the intent.
The current implementation applies `sqrt(x_motion^2 + y_motion^2)` where x_motion/y_motion
are either `abs(diff)` or `diff^2`. For "squared" method, this means `sqrt((x_diff^2)^2 + (y_diff^2)^2)`.
If the intent for "squared" is `sum(x_diff^2 + y_diff^2)` before sqrt, the logic in aggregation
might need adjustment based on precise definition. Assuming current implementation is desired.

When aggregating keypoints, values are summed
across all valid keypoints for each frame.
}
\note{
The first frame of each group will have NA motion values since there's
  no previous frame for comparison. These are removed when na_action = "omit".
  Requires ggplot2 package for plotting.
